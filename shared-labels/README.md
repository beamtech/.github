# Shared labels for PRs

This folder contains shared configs for the https://github.com/beamtech/labeler action, which attaches labels to our various PRs based on business domains. Many of these configs will be in individual repos, but the ones here are cross-cutting concerns where the file patterns apply the same way to multiple repos.
