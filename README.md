# Default Community Health Files

This repo intends to standardize: 

- Pull Request templates
- Issue templates
- Contributing documentation
- Code of conduct documentation

For more information, reference GitHub's [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization) on `.github` repos and community health files

Any singular repo can choose to override these default files with templates of their own.
